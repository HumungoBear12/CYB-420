                                                <p style="width: 90%;">The Bangladesh Bank Heist was a cyber operation believed to have been conducted by North Korea's Lazarus Group in 2016. The group attempted to steal around $1 billion from Bangladesh Central bank utilizing SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), which is a messaging system that conducts the banks global interbank payments. Lazarus was able to get a hold of the bank's SWIFT network to begin conducting fraudulent transactions. Lazarus was able to steal $81 million before the bank stopped them. Majority of the money was found to have been sent to casinos in the Philippines but all the money was gone by the time official found out.  </p>

                                                <h4>Strategy Goals:</h4>
                                                <p style="width: 90%">The goals of cyber operations like the Bangladesh bank heist is to steal from and disrupt a nation-state's financial infrastructure. The Lazarus group infiltrated the bank's SWIFT network to carry out theft without detection.</p>

                                                <h4>Recommended Offensive Tools:</h4>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><strong>The Metasploit Framework</strong> (Access and Escalation Tool)
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li style="width: 90%">The Metasploit Framework would likely be the best logical access and escalation tool in this case, as it is very customizable. It would be able to help hackers both gain access to financial networks and escalate their privilages within the network. The framework also offers post accessing modules that would help the hackers maintain access or in this case, allow Lazarus to get closer in reaching their initial goal of $1 billion.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li><strong>HTTPS or DNS Common Protocols</strong> (Exfiltration Tool)
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li style="width: 90%">Utilizing common protocols such as HTTP or DNS would allow hackers to exfiltrate data without triggering alarms since normal network traffic often use these protocols. In this case, it would allow Lazarus to mask data theft within SWIFT's regular traffic patterns, allowing them to stay undetected longer.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li><strong>Adding "Authorized Access"</strong> (Sustainment Tool)
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li style="width: 90%">Adding "authorized" access would allow hackers to create or manipulate legitimate accounts within a bank's system or in this case the SWIFT networking. Creating or using accounts with higher access privilages would allow Lazarus to continually initiate or approve transactions as if they are legitimate transactions. This would reduce the risk of being detected since the transactions would appear to come from "authorized" sources and allow ongoing access which could have helped Lazarus reach the goal of $1 billion.</li>
                                                        </ul>

                                                    <li><strong>International Financial Regulations:</strong> The Financial Action Task Force has blacklisted North Korea due to their involvement in financial crimes. The blacklisting reduces the nation-state's access to the international financial systems and subjects North Korea to increased scrutiny.   </li>
