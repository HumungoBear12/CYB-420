                                                 <p style="width: 90%;">DeTankZone is a North Korean cyber espionage campaign conducted by the Lazarus group with their subgroup named BlueNoroff. This planned attack went above and beyond with their social engineering. They used source code from a game called DEFI TankLand and altered it to DeTankZone that set up their zero-day exploit of Google Chrome. People that visited the website, ended up with a script embedded in it called index.tsx to exploit CVE-2024-4947 that gave the lazarus group full control over the PCs. With full access to the PC, the group would then decide if they wannted to continue the attack based off the crypto balance of these people. It would then download a backdoor called Manuscrypt that the group has used since 2016. This is how Kapersky was able to find the Chrome vulnerability. </p>

The use of an X account and paid LinkedIn profiles promoting the website led users to trusting the site which led to their system being breached.</li>

If people dont know the risks of opening risky sites or downloading games online, then more situations like this happen. Especially with an attack like this, they went so in depth with the social engineering, this would be a great example of the depths people go to in order to gain access to your PC.</li>
